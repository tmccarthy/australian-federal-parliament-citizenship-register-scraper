# Australian Federal Parliament Citizenship Register scraper

A half-finished project that attempted to use [Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) to parse the 
citizenship register for Australian parliamentarians (eg [for the Senate of the 46th parliament](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Senators_Interests/RegisterQual46thparl)).

In the end Textract was neither accurate nor cheap enough to make this worthwhile, but there's some good stuff in here 
and I might revisit it one day.
